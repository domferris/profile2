I was looking to revamp my personal site and wanted to use this profile to practice with Eleventy, Tailwind CSS, Alpine.js, Barba.js, and Webpack.

I also wanted to showcase more of a complete profile that included some portfolio pieces from my previous career as a young filmmaker in Los Angeles that found his way from freelance directing to full-time editing to post-production supervising and more; eventually finding a passion documenting the city's growing social change movements and independent music scene.
