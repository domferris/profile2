            GameStahp is my ongoing personal playground application for small, browser-based games. I wanted to build out a site that anyone could visit to play their favorite nostalgic games anytime, anywhere.
          </p>
          <p class="leading-relaxed">
            My intention with this project is to build out games one by one. My next goal, after working out the known bugs and building out a level generator for Brick Breaker, is to add a high score system so that players can track their progress in the old-school arcade way with their three initials.

            The art direction for the site is a mixture of old-school arcade cabinets and a shameless parody of GameStop. Each game's design was inspired by my first encounter with them -- Snake from the old Nokia phones my older cousins had, Brick Breaker from the original GameBoy, and Minesweeper from my old Windows computer. There are instructions and rules for each.

            After ensuring each of the existing games work well enough to play from start to game over, high score will be in the works. I have built out the initial API with Ruby on Rails but have not implemented it just yet because the games are riddled with bugs. I plan on adding Tetris next as well as building out a "remote control" that takes in player inputs via keyboard and adjusts per game.
