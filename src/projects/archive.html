          GameStahp is my ongoing personal playground application for small, browser-based games. I wanted to build out a site that anyone could visit to play their favorite nostalgic games anytime, anywhere.
        </p>
        <p class="leading-relaxed text-gray-800">
          My intention with this project is to build out games one by one. My next goal, after working out the known bugs and building out a level generator for Brick Breaker, is to add a high score system so that players can track their progress in the old-school arcade way with their three initials.

          The art direction for the site is a mixture of old-school arcade cabinets and a shameless parody of GameStop. Each game's design was inspired by my first encounter with them -- Snake from the old Nokia phones my older cousins had, Brick Breaker from the original GameBoy, and Minesweeper from my old Windows computer. There are instructions and rules for each.
        </p>

          After ensuring each of the existing games work well enough to play from start to game over, high score will be in the works. I have built out the initial API with Ruby on Rails but have not implemented it just yet because the games are riddled with bugs. I plan on adding Tetris next as well as building out a "remote control" that takes in player inputs via keyboard and adjusts per game.
