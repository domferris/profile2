        <p class="text-sm">
          My name is Dominic. I am a recent career changer. I was a Los Angeles-based filmmaker and photographer with my last full-time job being Assistant Editor for a ViacomCBS ad agency where I supervised post production on ad campaigns for brands such as Google Pixel, McDonalds, Folgers, Target, Pampers, and many more.

        <p class="text-sm">
          I decided to pivot because I have always followed and loved the landscape of technology and would like to contribute to its future. Because I wanted to jump in sooner than later, I attended the Le Wagon coding bootcamp after some months of self-teaching to fast charge my education.

        <p class="text-sm">
          Le Wagon's curriculum helped me grasp the core concepts of programming through Ruby. After studying the fundamentals, I learned how to create smaller-scale products using Ruby on Rails via Heroku.

        <p class="text-sm">
          I have since taught myself JavaScript. I am currently learning React on Udemy and studying the basics of CS on edX. My first gig in the industry utilized Jekyll, Ruby on Rails, Liquid, Stimulus.js, and PostgreSQL, though I worked primarily with Jekyll and Liquid. This sparked my interest in the Jamstack architechture of web development and I am currently building my new website with Eleventy, Tailwind CSS, and Alpine.js.

        Work
      </h3>
      <div class="space-y-6">
        <p class="text-sm">
          I recently ended a contract with Page Bird where I directly communicated with 26 of their clients, maintaining and updating their websites via Netlify. I am volunteering on a nonprofit application that is built with React Native and Next.js via Expo. Because my knowledge is limited in that space, I contribute where I can while actively learning the technologies.
        </p>
        <p class="text-sm">
          I am open for hire. Though I have an idea where I want to go in the industry as far as fields I would like to support with my skills, I am a new developer and I'm open to any opportunities where I can continue to learn and grow. If you think I could be a good fit for your company or project, please feel free to <a href="/contact">reach out</a>.
