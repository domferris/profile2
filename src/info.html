          My name is Dominic. I am a recent career changer. I was a Los <span class="whitespace-nowrap">Angeles-based</span> filmmaker and photographer with my last <span class="whitespace-nowrap">full-time</span> job being Assistant Editor for a ViacomCBS ad agency where I supervised post production on ad campaigns for brands such as Google Pixel, McDonalds, Folgers, Target, Pampers, and many more.

          I decided to pivot because I have always followed and loved the landscape of technology and would like to contribute to its future. Because I wanted to jump in sooner than later, I attended the Le Wagon coding bootcamp after some months of <span class="whitespace-nowrap">self-teaching</span> to fast charge my education.
