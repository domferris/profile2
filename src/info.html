          My name is Dominic. I am a recent career changer. I was a Los Angeles-based filmmaker and photographer with my last full-time job being Assistant Editor for a ViacomCBS ad agency where I supervised post production on ad campaigns for brands such as Google Pixel, McDonalds, Folgers, Target, Pampers, and many more.

          I decided to pivot because I have always followed and loved the landscape of technology and would like to contribute to its future. Because I wanted to jump in sooner than later, I attended the Le Wagon coding bootcamp after some months of self-teaching to fast charge my education.
